# [Ahrain v1 - Open Source Rain Notifier](https://ahra.in)



Rain sucks. Getting caught in the rain sucks even more! Well what can you do about it? **..Ahrain!**

Ahrain is a tool we devoped to alert you if the day is going to be rainy. Furthermore, a tool that will ONLY notify you **IF** they day is going to be rainy, else dead silence (anti-spam!). And if the day ahead will be rainy, Arhain will deliver you an email in the morning containing the forecast of the day to help you stay dry!

Here's why it's awesome:

* Runs an automated rain check every 24h at a customized time
* Delivers an email only if there will be rain
* Fits into your morning email digest
* Microptimizes your day by saving you time of doing the repetitive task of checking the weather just for rain every day..
* ..open source!
